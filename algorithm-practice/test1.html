  <p style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Contemporary dance is interpretative in nature and it focuses on
    emotions and storytelling. It can be performed with pointe shoes or barefoot, with or without music. It is about
    breaking structure - it can be balletic, wholly abstract, jazz-influenced, lyrical, folk-influenced or
    unconventional. </p>
  <p>Contemporary dance allows freedom of movement, and hence is a very interesting class for complete beginners of
    dance. Even with less training, you can test the extremes of your body and you don't have to worry about perfect
    turnout or perfect feet. It is challenging physically and emotionally as your teacher will constantly remind you to
    push the boundaries of what you think is possible. That is the beauty of the form. It is a reflective form and has
    the ability to transform you via self-discovery.</p>
  <p>Teachers will break down the movements for you, to make it easy for you to grasp, but he or she will also encourage
    individual exploration through improvisation sessions.</p>
  <h2 class="h2_heading">Background</h2>
  <p>Contemporary dance began in Europe and USA in the late 19th and early 20th century. Then it was heavily influenced
    by Jazz, Modern and classical Ballet. Over the years, it's incorporate elements from Folk, ethnic and many other
    styles of dance. It is a form of self expression, in which each artist has the freedom to determine his or her
    creative path.
  <p>Modern dance pioneers, Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham created new technique and vocabulary, which influences
    how we dance today. At Priming Dance, our biggest inspiration for contemporary dance is the Netherlands Dans Theater
    and the KCDC Israel.</p>
